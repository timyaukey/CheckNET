    <h1>Financial Statements</h1>
    <p>
        Willow Creek Checkbook is a full <a href="intro.html#double-entry-bookkeeping">double entry bookkeeping system</a>, 
        so it can be used to prepare familiar accounting statments like
        a Balance Sheet and a Profit and Loss statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the options to do this are available
        by clicking "Financial Statements" on the "Reports" menu. 
        This will display the "Trial Balance and Statements" form.
        This form lets you enter the dates you wish to prepare statements
        for at the top, compute a trial balance of all your accounts
        for those dates, and then produce a variety of standard
        accounting statements with that information.
    </p>
    <p>
        All these activities only include "real" transactions, i.e.
        they ignore things that don't represent "real" money or "accrued"
        value like accounts payable or accounts receivable. Examples of things
        that will be ignored include "bank" transactions with the "fake" box checked,
        and budget transactions. It will also exclude balance sheets accounts of type
        "personal", and categories of type "personal".
    </p>
    <h2>Trial Balance</h2>
    <p>
        Regardless of which accounting statement(s) you need, the first step in producing them
        is to enter the dates you want to create statements for and compute the trial balance.
        Enter the dates at the top of the form, and click "Trial Balance."
    </p>
    <p>
        The software will then total up, by account, all amounts from "real" transactions dated 
        on or before the "End Date" at the top of the form. It will display these totals in
        two lists in the middle of the form. The first list shows transaction totals for
        balance sheet accounts, and the second shows transaction totals for income / expense
        accounts (categories). Each list groups accounts by account type, so all your
        checking accounts appear together under account type "Asset - Checking Account" in
        the first list, all your "cost of goods sold" accounts (categories) appear together
        under that heading in the second list, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The totals in the trial balance lists are the same as the corresponding figures
        in the balance sheet and profit and loss statements for the same dates, but the
        balance sheet and profit and loss statements combine many accounts together for brevity.
        For example, the balance sheet shows only one line with the combined total
        balances of all checking accounts, but the trial balance will show each
        checking account separately. And the profit and loss has only one line for
        total cost of goods sold, but the trial balance will break that total down
        into subtotals for each category classified as a cost of goods sold category.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you first open the form the only button that will be enabled is the
        "Trial Balance" button. This is consistent with accounting best practices,
        where you prepare a trial balance to double check your account balances
        before preparing final accounting statements. After you click "Trial Balance",
        all the other buttons on the form will be enabled.
    </p>
    <h2>Retained Earnings</h2>
    <p>
        A standard accounting practice, followed at the end of each accounting period,
        is to transfer your net profit, i.e. the balances of all your income and expense accounts (categories),
        to a "retained earnings" account on your balance sheet. Thus "retained earnings"
        is the running sum of all the net profits from your business, and the balances
        of your income and expense accounts only show your income and expenses
        for the current accounting period.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step after running the trial balance, and looking at the account
        totals to confirm they make sense, is generally to post your profits (or losses) 
        to retained earnings by clicking
        "Post Retained Earnings". This will create a single transaction in your
        "Retained Earnings" account, with one split for each income / expense
        account having a non-zero balance as of the end date at the top of the
        form. If you find a mistake in your income or expense transactions for
        the period after doing this, you can easily correct this by deleting
        this "transfer" transaction from your "Retained Earnings" account and
        clicking the "Post Retained Earnings" button again after fixing the transaction problem(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Retained Earnings" account is a balance sheet
        account in Willow Creek Checkbook just like any other, with the account type
        "Equity - Retained Earnings". You'll have to create this account in your
        company if you want to create financial statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        This activity of transferring to retained earnings will be unfamiliar
        to users of some other accounting packages, particularly Quickbooks,
        because those systems create this transaction for you automatically
        when needed, without being asked, instead of expecting you to click a 
        button to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your accounting periods can be whatever you want them to be, but should
        probably correspond to when you reconcile and double check your
        accounting records for other purposes, such as preparing tax returns.
        You could only do this once a year, but realistically most businesses
        have reasons to produce accounting statements quarterly, or even monthly,
        so they'll post to retained earnings then as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Always create your "Post Retained Earnings" transaction before creating
        any accounting statements. You only have to do this once for each
        accounting period, not each time you run the statements.
    </p>
    <h2>Balance Sheet</h2>
    <p>
        The "Balance Sheet" button will produce a balance sheet statement, with account
        balances as of "End Date" from the top of the form. The company name at the
        top of the report is the name entered on the "Company Information" form, 
        which is listed on the "Setup" menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accounts are grouped on the balance sheet by the class of the account types.
        For example, all the loans payable to your business will be listed together
        in the "Assets" section of your balance sheet and all the loans owed by you to someone 
        else will be listed together in the "Liabilities" section of your balance sheet.
        These groupings are the same ones used in the trial balance lists.
    </p>
    <p>
        The balance sheet statement may combine the balances of some accounts into a single
        line, and may omit that combined summary line entirely if that combined total is zero.
        This behavior is also controlled on the "Company Information" form, where there
        are two settings each for loans receivable, loans payable, and real property.
        The first option controls whether accounts of that type are combined into a single
        line, and the second controls whether that line will be omitted if the total is zero.
        These settings are hardcoded for other account types - for example, checking accounts
        are always combined into one line on the balance sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not post net income to retained earnings before producing the balance
        sheet, the net income will appear as a line labeled "Net Income" in the "Equity"
        section of your balance sheet. This means you can produce a balance sheet in the
        middle of an accounting period, and it will show your account balances as of
        that arbitrary date and your net income as of the same date.
    </p>
    <h2>Profit and Loss</h2>
    <p>
        The "Profit and Loss" button will produce a standard profit and loss statement
        from the income and expense categories you used in your transactions.
        The income and expense accounts will be organized by the category type of the
        categories, like "Cost of Goods Sold" and "Operating Expenses".
        These groupings are the same ones used in the trial balance lists.
    </p>
    <h2>Loans Receivable</h2>
    <p>
        The "Loans Receivable" button will produce a statement of the balances of your
        loans receivable accounts as of the end date at the top of the form.
        These same lines will appear on your balance sheet, or as a single summary
        line with the combined total if you have configured your balance sheet that way.
    </p>
    <h2>Loans Payable</h2>
    <p>
        The "Loans Payable" button is the same as "Loans Receivable", but for loans
        payable accounts.
    </p>
    <h2>Accounts Receivable</h2>
    <p>
        The "A/R Age Summary" button will produce an accounts receivable statement
        as of the end date at the top of the form, with aging, using the aging date from the
        top of the form to compute the age of each amount.
    </p>
    <p>
        This report will include a separate line for each distinct value found in the
        "Description" field of transactions in your "Accounts Receivable" account.
        Since the "Description" will generally be the name of the customer
        who owes you money, this results in one line on the report for each customer.
        To compensate for meaningless spelling differences, only the first 16 characters
        of each name are used to find transactions for a customer, and upper and lower
        case letters are considered equivalent. Thus "J. Finch and Company" and "J. Finch And Company, Inc."
        are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        Willow Creek Checkbook does not create an "Accounts Receivable" balance
        sheet account automatically for a new company, so you'll have to create one if
        you want to track receivables for your business. This is just a regular
        asset account, with the appropriate account type chosen by you on the "Account Properties" form.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "A/R Unpaid Invoices" button will produce a report similar to the "A/R Age Summary"
        report, but listing the unpaid invoices by vendor in addition to aging.
    </p>
    <p>
        These reports use "open item" payment allocation when possible, and fall back to "balance forward"
        payment allocation on payments that cannot be applied to a specific invoice number for any reason.
        This means that when the invoice and payment have matching payee names and matching
        invoice numbers, and some part of the invoice is still unpaid, that payment is applied to that
        invoice up to the amount still owing on the invoice. All other payments, including unused
        parts of payments that contain an invoice number but could not be applied using the "open item" method,
        are applied to the oldest unpaid invoice. All possible "open item" allocations are done before
        using the "balance forward" method.
    </p>
    <h2>Accounts Payable</h2>
    <p>
        The "A/P Age Summary" and "A/P Unpaid Invoices" buttons produce statements equivalent
        to the "A/R Age Summary" and "A/R Unpaid Invoices" 
        statements, but for transactions in your "Accounts Payable" account.
