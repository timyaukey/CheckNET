    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Willow Creek Checkbook is a full featured double-entry bookkeeping system;
        one that uses the familiar "checkbook" paradigm for entering and presenting transactions.
        It can be used to keep the "books" for your family, a business, a charity, a club,
        or any other entity that wants to keep track of money.
        The software borrows many concepts from the familiar Quicken and Quickbooks software,
        such as transactions with categories and splits, but has many unique features as well
        particularly in the area of budgeting.
    </p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        Like all accounting or checkbook software, Willow Creek Checkbook organizes transactions
        into accounts and displays those accounts in scrollable windows that are meant to
        look like the familiar paper "checkbook register" booklets with the date, payee,
        amount, running balance and other information for each transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        The software can also print checks, import transactions from banks and other sources,
        produce a variety of reports, reconcile your
        accounts with records from the financial institution that holds the account (banks,
        mortgage companies, etc.), and many other things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where things first depart from the Quicken / Quickbooks model is how transactions are
        organized in an account, and the different kinds of transactions an account
        can contain.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get very specific about the way data is organized...
    </p>
    <h2>Companies</h2>
    <p>
        A "company" is the top level organizational
        unit holding accounting information in this software. A company in this software
        can represent a business in the real world, your household if you are using
        the software for personal finance, or any other entity you wish to keep track
        of financial information for. When you start the software,
        you choose which company you want to work with. You can have multiple companies,
        but you only open one at a time in this software.
    </p>
    <h2>Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        A "company" contains one or more
        "accounts", like bank accounts, credit card accounts, and mortgage loan accounts.
        To your accountant or bookkeeper (if you use one) these are "balance sheet accounts".
        If the company is a business that wants to do full fledged double entry bookkeeping,
        it can also have some other balance sheet
        accounts like "accounts payable", "accounts receivable", "inventory", and equity
        accounts representing money invested and retained earnings.
    </p>
    <h2>Registers</h2>
    <p>
        So far, companies and accounts are exactly what you'd expect. But now things will
        get a bit different: An account can have more than one register, each with its
        own running balance. This is a way of dividing up an account into separate pools of money,
        used by different people (or for different purposes)
        and tracking how much is left for each one.
        Think of the old example of cashing a paycheck and dividing up that money into envelopes
        for different purposes. When you reconcile an account with a statement from the
        account holder, the software shows the transactions from all the registers in that
        account together for purposes of reconciling.
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't have to use multiple registers for an account, and frequently you won't, but
        this capability gives you one way of managing budgets. Remember how I mentioned
        at the top of this page all the budgeting tools in this software? Multiple
        registers in each account is one of those tools.
    </p>
    <h2>Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Each register is made up of transactions, like bank deposits, checks written,
        debit card purchases, etc. An innovation of Willow Creek Checkbook is that
        transactions don't always represent things that have actually happened - they
        can represent things that you plan to do, or expect to happen. For example,
        you can enter a transaction for your monthly mortgage payment and give it the date
        you expect to make the payment, even though you haven't paid it yet. This transaction
        will be subtracted from the running balance in your register on that future date,
        so you can forecast your cash flow into the future. You flag these transactions
        as "fake" in the software, so you can keep track of them and not count them
        as real money in places you would not want to. For example, they are ignored
        when reconciling bank statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is also a transaction type
        that represents a pool of money that you want to reserve for a particular use
        during a particular period
        of time, like a weekly grocery budget. This money is taken out of the running balance
        in the register on the end date of the budget period, so you don't think that money
        is still available after the budget period is done. As you enter real transactions that spend
        that budget, the amount of the budget transaction is automatically adjusted
        downward.
    </p>
    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <p>
        Transactions that represent something happening in the real world (checks,
        debit card purchases, credit card payments, etc.) are assigned a "category".
        Just like Quicken or Quickbooks, this represents what the money was used
        for. Like "groceries", "gasoline", or "mortgage." Some transactions are
        used for multiple purposes, like buying clothing and a small appliance
        at the same time at a department store. In this case you can divide up
        the transaction into multiple "splits", each with a separate dollar amount
        and category.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are doing full fledged double entry bookkeeping, these categories
        are the income and expense accounts in your chart of accounts. Thus a
        transaction contains both parts of the double entry - the account the
        transaction is entered into is one half of the double entry, and the
        category(s) you use represent the other half. And you'll be happy
        to know that you can also use other balance sheet accounts for categories
        in your transactions as well. Thus you can enter your mortgage payment
        into your bank account, and for the category use the liability account
        representing the loan balance.
