    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Willow Creek Checkbook uses the familiar "checkbook" paradigm for recording and
        displaying your financial information. Under the hood it is actually a
        full general ledger "double entry" bookkeeping system that will keep your accountant happy
        (if you use one), but you will always see the information presented like a paper
        check register.
        Willow Creek Checkbook can be used to keep the "books" for your family, a business, a charity, a club,
        or any other entity that owns accounts or wants to keep track of money.
        The software borrows many concepts from the familiar Quicken and Quickbooks software,
        such as transactions with categories and splits, but has many unique features as well,
        particularly in the area of budgeting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like most other accounting or checkbook software, Willow Creek Checkbook organizes transactions
        into accounts and displays those accounts in scrollable windows that are meant to
        look like the familiar paper "checkbook register" booklets. Each register entry
        contains the date, check number, payee, amount, running balance and other information for one transaction.
        Registers always show transactions in transaction date order, regardless of the
        order you entered them in, and will move transactions around in the register if
        you change the date.
    </p>
    <p>
        The software can also print checks, import transactions from banks and other sources,
        produce a variety of reports, reconcile your
        accounts with records from the financial institution that holds the account (banks,
        mortgage companies, etc.), and many other things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where things first depart from the Quicken / Quickbooks model is how transactions are
        organized in an account, and the different kinds of transactions an account
        can contain.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get very specific about the way data is organized...
    </p>
    <h2>Companies</h2>
    <p>
        A "company" is the top level organizational
        unit holding information in this software. A company in this software
        can represent a business in the real world, your household if you are using
        the software for personal finance, or any other entity you wish to keep track
        of financial information for. When you start the software,
        you choose which company you want to work with. You can have multiple companies,
        but you only open one at a time in this software.
    </p>
    <h2>Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        A "company" contains one or more
        "accounts", like bank accounts, credit card accounts, and mortgage loan accounts.
        To your accountant or bookkeeper (if you use one) these are "balance sheet accounts".
        If the company is a business that wants to do full fledged double entry bookkeeping,
        it can also have some other balance sheet
        accounts like "accounts payable", "accounts receivable", "inventory", and equity
        accounts representing money invested and retained earnings.
    </p>
    <h2>Registers</h2>
    <p>
        So far, companies and accounts are exactly what you'd expect. But now things will
        get a bit different: An account can have more than one register, each with its
        own running balance. This is a way of dividing up an account into separate pools of money,
        used by different people (or for different purposes)
        and tracking how much is left for each one.
        Think of the old example of cashing a paycheck and dividing up that money into envelopes
        for different purposes. When you reconcile an account with a statement from the
        account holder, the software shows the transactions from all the registers in that
        account together for purposes of reconciling.
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't have to use multiple registers for an account, and frequently you won't, but
        this capability gives you one way of managing budgets. Remember how I mentioned
        at the top of this page all the budgeting tools in this software? Multiple
        registers in each account is one of those tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        See your list of accounts and registers by clicking "File" on the main menu,
        and then "Registers and Accounts". You can open the register window for any
        register here, and also create new accounts and registers
        and perform several other maintenance tasks on them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transactions">Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Each register is made up of transactions, like bank deposits, checks written,
        debit card purchases, etc. An innovation of Willow Creek Checkbook is that
        transactions don't always represent things that have actually happened - they
        can represent things that you plan to do, or expect to happen. For example,
        you can enter a transaction for your monthly mortgage payment and give it the date
        you expect to make the payment, even though you haven't paid it yet. This transaction
        will be subtracted from the running balance in your register on that future date,
        so you can forecast your cash flow into the future. You flag these transactions
        as "fake" in the software, so you can keep track of them and not count them
        as real money in places you would not want to. For example, they are ignored
        when reconciling bank statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is also a transaction type
        that represents a pool of money that you want to reserve for a particular use
        during a particular period
        of time, like a weekly grocery budget. This money is taken out of the running balance
        in the register on the end date of the budget period, so you don't think that money
        is still available after the budget period is done. As you enter real transactions that spend
        that budget, the amount of the budget transaction is automatically adjusted
        downward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Budgeting tools will be discussed in much greater detail <a href="HelpBudget.html">elsewhere in this documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A regular transaction, i.e. "bank" transaction, has at a minimum a transaction date, transaction
        number, description, category, and amount. The description is generally the
        name of the payee or a phrase like "bank deposit". The category says what the transaction
        is for - like "groceries" or "utilities". The transaction number is the check number if the
        transaction represents a check, or one of the following codes: "dep" for deposit,
        "card" for debit or credit card purchase, "inv" for invoice,
        "crm" for credit memo, "eft" for electronic funds transfer, "ord" for an order, 
        or "pmt" for some other kind of payment like an ACH payment through your bank.
    </p>
    <p>
        A transaction can also optionally have a budget type, purchase order number,
        invoice number, due date, and memo. If a transaction was used for multiple purposes, like
        buying groceries and office supplies, you can "split" the amount into smaller amounts.
        Each split has its own category, budget type, purchase order and invoice numbers, due date,
        memo and amount. You can create as many splits for a transaction as you like. Only regular
        transactions can have splits.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are buttons at the bottom of the register form to create each type of transaction
        in that register, and "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to edit or delete the currently
        highlighted transaction regardless of what type it is.
    </p>
    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <p>
        Transactions that represent something happening in the real world (checks,
        debit card purchases, credit card payments, etc.) are assigned a "category".
        Just like Quicken or Quickbooks, this represents what the money was used
        for. Like "groceries", "gasoline", or "mortgage." Some transactions are
        used for multiple purposes, like buying clothing and a small appliance
        at the same time at a department store. In this case you can divide up
        the transaction into multiple "splits", each with a separate dollar amount
        and category.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are doing full fledged double entry bookkeeping, these categories
        are the income and expense accounts in your chart of accounts. Thus a
        transaction contains both parts of the double entry - the account the
        transaction is entered into is one half of the double entry, and the
        category(s) you use represent the other half. And you'll be happy
        to know that you can also use other balance sheet accounts for categories
        in your transactions as well. Thus you can enter your mortgage payment
        into your bank account, and for the category use the liability account
        representing the loan balance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that I've explained about using balance sheet accounts as categories,
        there is one other transaction type that may be confusing when you first see it -
        a "replicated" transaction. These are created automatically in another register
        when you use a balance sheet account as the category in a split. For example,
        you can enter a loan payment into the register for your checking account,
        using the loan account as the category.
        After doing this, if you open the register for your loan account you will see
        a replicated transaction representing the split. Though it might seem like the
        transaction has been entered twice, in fact you are seeing the two sides of
        the same transaction. Don't worry, it won't be counted twice anywhere.
    </p>
    <h2>Memorized Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        To simplify the task of entering transactions the software lets you create
        "memorized transactions", which are templates from which you can create
        many real transactions with the same information. A memorized transaction
        can be as minimal as a payee name, so you use the same payee name all the
        time for transactions related to that payee. For example, you could have
        a memorized transaction for "Amazon.com". That way you won't enter half of
        your Amazon.com transactions as "Amazon.com" and the rest as "Amazon".
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add other information to your memorized transaction as well, like
        a category, memo, and/or amount.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can create both regular bank transactions and budget transactions
        through this mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
        Memorized transactions are used in two places. First, When you are entering a
        transaction manually type a few characters of the payee name and then press
        "control-S" to search for a memorized transaction whose payee name
        starts with the same characters. It will
        fill in the rest of the transaction from the matching memorized
        transaction, if it can find one. If it finds several matching
        memorized transactions you will have the opportunity to choose one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, the process of importing transactions from a bank download will
        automatically look up the imported transaction descriptions for matching
        information in the memorized transactions and set the payee name and
        category from the matching memorized transaction. The technique for
        matching imported information to memorized transactions is a little
        more sophisticated than that, but that's generally how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can manage your memorized transactions by clicking "Setup" on
        the main menu, and then "Memorized Transactions".
    </p>
    <h2>Generated Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        The software can automatically create multiple copies of the same
        transaction over time for you, like your monthly mortgage payment.
        These are called "generated transactions". You can choose the pattern
        of when the transactions are dated, for example once a month, once a
        week, every 10 days, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        A generated transaction normally always has the same amount, but
        there are ways to change the amount over time as well. For example,
        you can set up a generated transaction for your electricity bill that
        is higher during the summer when you are using electricity for air
        conditioning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generated transactions are recreated every time you open a company, so
        you can change the definition and see those changes reflected in your
        registers the next time you open the company. You can also tell it
        to recreate generated transactions while you have the company open.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generated transactions are always created as "fake" transactions,
        because they haven't happened yet in the real world. You can uncheck
        the "fake" box as needed, for example when you actually pay the bill.
        The "fake" box will automatically be unchecked when you match the
        transaction in a bank import. Once you uncheck "fake" on a generated
        transaction, whether manually or by matching it to a bank import,
        it will no longer be touched when regenerating transactions. The
        software will be smart enough to recognize that the transaction
        was generated at one time, and won't touch it or create a new
        generated transaction for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can manage your generated transactions for each register (and regenerate them)
        by clicking "File" on the main menu and then "Registers and Accounts".
    </p>
    <h2>Importing Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        This subject will be covered in greater depth elsewhere, but the software
        has many ways to import transactions from external sources like files
        downloaded from your bank and data copied and pasted from spreadsheets.
    </p>
    <h2>Double Entry Bookkeeping</h2>
    <p>
        This subject has been touched on in some of the discussions above,
        but Willow Creek Checkbook is actually a full featured double entry
        bookkeeping system. It has a full chart of accounts, a general ledger,
        and if you need them all the special accounts like accounts receivable
        and various equity accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The register you create a transaction in identifies the account for
        one half of the double entry, and the category you choose identifies
        the other half of the entry. In the ordinary case there are just two
        entries, both for the amount of the transaction. The first
        entry will be for a balance sheet account, and the second will be
        the income or expense account represented by the category you used. If you
        enter multiple splits, there will be a separate bookkeeping entry
        for each one. Notice how it is impossible to create a transaction
        that is out of balance, because one side of the transaction is
        always computed from the other!
    </p>
    <p>
        The software supports both accrual basis accounting and cash basis
        accounting. The difference is mostly the transaction dates you use,
        and the fact that for accrual basis accounting you will create accounts
        in the software for
        accounts payable and accounts receivable.
    </p>
    <p>
        For purposes of double entry bookkeeping, "fake" and "budget" transactions
        are simply ignored because they don't represent real world activity.
        They are merely placeholders for things we expect to happen. The financial
        statement reports do this automatically.
    </p>
