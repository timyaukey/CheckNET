    <h1>Reporting and Searching</h1>
    <p>
        There are several tools to search for and report on information in Willow Creek Checkbook.
        Most are options on the "Reports" menu, but probably the single most useful tool on a day-to-day
        basis is the "Search" button on the register form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of these tools are described below, and others are described by their own dedicated help files.
    </p>
    <h2>Interactive Register Search</h2>
    <p>
        The easiest way to find transactions matching a wide variety of criteria is with the "Search"
        button on the register form. This will display the "Search" form for the register, that will find
        and display transactions matching many, many different criteria you may choose.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the "Search" form, enter the beginning and ending dates of the date range you wish to search,
        and choose the criteria you want to use for matching transactions. For example, you could say
        you want to find all transaction dated between 1/1/2018 and 2/1/2018 whose payee name starts with "Amazon".
        Or you could look for all transactions in that range with a category equal to "E:Accounting".
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of these search criteria operate on information that applies to the transaction as a whole, like
        payee name, and others apply to information that applies to individual splits, like category. The search
        will display transaction level information if that's what you searched for, and split level information
        if that's what you searched for. For example, if you search for category matches it will show the
        amount of the split, not the amount of the whole transaction. There will be no difference between
        the two in many cases, but if the transaction has multiple splits it will show the amount from 
        the matching split. If there are multiple matching splits in a transaction, the results will show
        a separate row for each matching split.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've executed a search, it will display all matching transactions in that register. And you can
        do more than just look at them - you can edit them right from the search form, but you can also
        select one or more of them by checking the box next to each one in the list, and then perform one of
        several options on all checked transactions. For example, you can change the category of all the
        checked transactions, or change the dates, or combine them into a single transaction with multiple
        splits.
    </p>
    <h2>Find Live Budgets</h2>
    <p>
        This option on the "Reports" menu will let you enter a date and choose a budget type, and then show you all
        budget transactions for that budget type that can be applied to bank transactions on that date. This option searches
        the register on the currently active register form, not the entire company.
    </p>
    <h2>Totals By Category</h2>
    <p>
        This option on the "Reports" menu will let you pick one or more accounts from your list of accounts,
        and a date range, and then show you dollar totals for each category for all transactions
        in the date range.
