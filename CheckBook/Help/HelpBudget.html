    <h1>Budgeting Tools</h1>
    <p>
        There are several ways of creating and managing budgets in the software,
        all of which work by adding an entry to a register that represents a
        planned or anticipated income or expense, or creating an entire register
        to track income and expenses dedicated to a particular purpose. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For more details on different transaction types, please
        see the <a href="HelpIntro.html#transactions">transactions</a> documentation.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Fake Transactions
    </h2>
    <p>
        The simplest form of budgeting is to enter a regular bank transaction
        for something you expect to happen on a specific date in the future. 
        This can be an income (deposit) transaction, like a regular paycheck,
        or any kind of expenditure, like a monthly mortgage payment. The
        key point is that this transaction represents a single event,
        not an activity that might occur as several events over time
        such as grocery purchases over a month.
    </p>
    <p>
        While each fake transaction represents one event, you can generate
        repeating transactions to represent the same event that happens
        repeatedly on a schedule, like a monthly paycheck. Or if the transaction
        is a one time event, like a planned home improvement purchase, you
        just create a single fake transaction for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        These fake
        transactions are just like any other bank transactions, except that
        their "fake" box is checked on the transaction edit form. They are added
        or subtracted from the running register balance on the transaction date,
        so the register balance reflects the balance you anticipate on that
        future date if all the future dated transactions actually happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fake transactions are automatically ignored in contexts where it makes
        sense to do so, for example when reconciling a bank statement. They are
        also ignored when preparing financial statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the fake transaction actually happens, for example you actually
        deposit your paycheck in your checking account, just uncheck the "fake" box
        on the transaction form. The "fake" box will also be unchecked on any 
        transaction matched during an import from a bank download.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fake transactions don't actually have to happen the way you anticipated.
        The amount might be different, in which case you would edit the amount
        at the same time you unchecked the fake box. Or the transaction might happen
        on a different date, in which case you'd change the date on the transaction
        form. Or the transaction might not happen at all, in which case you would
        simply delete it from your register.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Budget Types and Budget Transactions
    </h2>
    <p>
        Where a fake transaction is a placeholder for a single event you expect
        the happen in the future, a budget transaction is a placeholder in your
        register for any number of similar transactions that might occur during
        some period of time. The classic example is a budget transaction
        representing the total amount of money you are budgeting for entertainment
        for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
        The budget transaction has an end date, a budget period
        measured in days before that end date, a budget type, and an amount.
        The part of that amount that has not yet been used is subtracted 
        from the running register balance on that end date.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "amount that has not yet been used" is the key to understanding
        budget transactions. Initially when you create a budget transaction
        none of that budget amount has been used, so the entire budget
        amount will be subtracted from your register at the end of the
        budget period. Every time you enter a regular bank transaction
        that is counted against that budget transaction, the amount of
        that regular transaction is subtracted from the budget transaction.
        In essence, the budget amount is broken up into however many
        transactions actually occurred and those amounts transferred to
        the regular transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The link between a budget transaction and the regular transaction(s)
        that use it is the "budget type". Both budget transactions and
        regular transaction splits have a budget type, and any regular
        transaction matching the budget period and budget type of a budget
        transaction will be subtracted from the amount of that budget
        transaction.
    </p>
    <h2>The "(placeholder)" Budget Type</h2>
    <p>
        There is one budget type with special properties: The "(placeholder)" budget type.
        Unlike other budget types, "(placeholder)" is not used with budget transactions -
        only on splits for regular transactions. A split with the "(placeholder)" budget type
        is treated like a budget amount inside a regular
        transaction: As other splits are added to (or changed or deleted on) a transaction with
        a "(placeholder)" split, the amount of the "(placeholder)" split is adjusted so that the total
        amount of the transaction stays the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "(placeholder)" budget type is not automatically created for you
        when you install the software. You must created it yourself, and the name
        must be spelled exactly like that, including the parentheses.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "(placeholder)" budget type is really only useful in a single specialized
        scenario: You want to enter a single budget amount for a transaction you expect to later
        divide up into multiple splits, probably all staying in the same transaction.
        This could happen when a business sends a purchase order to a supplier, with
        a known amount or a reasonable guess as to the amount, but they expect to receive
        multiple invoices related to that purchase order. This happens quite a lot
        when businesses send complicated purchase orders for many different items
        to a distributor.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Using Multiple Registers
    </h2>
    <p>
        The last budgeting technique is simply to create a separate register where you
        set aside money and spend money for some purpose. It's like having a separate
        checking account at your bank where you save money for vacations and then
        write checks and use a debit card on that account while you're on vacation,
        but without actually needing to create an actual account at your bank.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every account in this software automatically starts out with a single register,
        but you can create additional register(s) for any account at any time on the
        "Registers and Accounts" form.
