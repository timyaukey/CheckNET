    <h1>Setup and Configuration</h1>
    <p>
        Setting up Willow Creek Checkbook is trivial,
        if you don't mind using a bunch of default settings.
        When you start the software, if it does not find any companies it will
        create one for you. This is what will happen the first time you start
        the software.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Companies</h2>
    <p>
        The software creates your first company automatically the first time you
        start it, but you can create more any time you like. When you start the
        software it will show you the list of companies it already knows about,
        but there will also be "New" button that will let you create a new company
        at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
        New companies automatically get a default set of categories and budget types,
        suitable for personal finance. You can change them, following the instructions
        below.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some other company configuration settings as well, such as the
        company name to show on reports. These can be found by clicking "Setup"
        on the main menu, then "Company Information".
    </p>
    <h2>Making Backups</h2>
    <p>
        You should ALWAYS make regular backups of every company you use. Each company
        is stored in a separate folder, so to make a backup of it you just need to
        make a backup of everything in that folder. See the <a href="HelpTechnical.html">technical notes</a>
        documentation for more information about ways to make backups.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        The software automatically creates one account when it creates a company,
        for one bank account. Each account automatically gets one register in the
        software. You can create more accounts any time you like,
        by clicking "File" on the main menu and then "Registers and Accounts".
        Then click "New Account". You can use this same window to rename and
        delete accounts, and set up their registers.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Categories</h2>
    <p>
        When the software creates a company it automatically creates a default
        set of categories to go along with it. These categories were chosen to
        be suitable for tracking home finances. You can change these categories,
        add new ones or delete ones. Click "Setup" on the main menu, then click "Categories".
    </p>
    <p>
        All accounts in a company share one set of categories.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Memorized Transactions</h2>
    <p>
        Once you've settled on a list of categories, it is reasonable to set
        up some memorized transactions that use those categories. The software
        comes with NO memorized transactions - you'll have to add your own.
        Click "Setup" on the main menu, and then click "Memorized Transactions".
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many pieces of information you can enter for a memorized transaction,
        but the only required information is the name. This will be used as the description
        or payee name when a transaction is created from the memorized transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use a memorized transaction to create a new transaction, or update
        information in an existing transaction. This will change existing information
        in the transaction you are updating, if that information was supplied in
        the memorized transaction. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The other major use of memorized transactions is to translate payee names on transactions
        imported from bank downloads and add category information to them. Bank downloads
        frequently use weirdly spelled payee names on debit/credit card purchases,
        names that are recognizable but still not what you want to use in your own records.
        And the bank downloads don't have any category information. There
        are fields in a memorized transaction specifically for the purpose of matching
        the information in the bank download to the memorized transaction
        you want to use for it, and once it finds a matching memorized transaction
        it will apply any category given in that memorized transaction.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Budget Types</h2>
    <p>
        The software uses "budget types" to classify amounts of money set aside for
        particular purposes. In general, each budget type will be associated with
        multiple budgets - each for a separate and non-overlapping range of dates.
        For example, you may have a budget type of "entertainment", with a separate
        budget of this type for each month. And that budget amount may be different
        for different months. 
    </P>
    <p>
        These specific budget date ranges and amounts are
        represented by budget transactions in your registers. Amounts are used
        out of these budget transactions by including a budget type in your regular
        transactions, on regular transactions dated inside the date range of the
        budget.
    </p>
    <p>
        All accounts in a company share a single list of budget types.
    </p>
    <p>
        The software creates a default set up budget types when you create a company,
        but you will probably want to customize it.
    </p>
    <h2>Preparing To Import From the Bank</h2>
    <p>
        Transactions downloaded from your bank frequently have extra characters added to
        the beginning or the end of the description or payee name, indicating something about
        the type of transaction. These extra "codes" are generally specific to each bank.
        For example, a bank may put the letters "ACH PMT:" in front of the payee name for
        all ACH payments you send through the banking website. Or "DEBIT-CARD/" for debit
        card purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will need to import some representative transactions from your bank to see
        what codes your bank uses. You generally don't want
        to include these codes in your transaction descriptions, though you may want to
        set certain transaction numbers like "card" for particular prefixes.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Transaction import types" let you specify prefix (or ending) strings that you want to 
        remove from downloaded transaction descriptions, and any transaction number you want
        to use when these codes are encountered. To enter and manage transaction import types,
        click "Setup" on the main menu and then "Transaction Import Types".
    </p>
    <h2>Preparing To Print Checks</h2>
    <p>
        The software can print checks on preprinted check paper that already has check
        numbers, and magnetic "MICR" codes at the bottom of the check. However, the software
        doesn't know what kind of checks you use. So will need to tell if where to print
        each piece of information on the blank checks, as measured in inches from the top
        left corner of the blank check. To do this, click "Setup" on the main menu and
        then "Check Format".
    </p>
    <h2>Creating Additional Users</h2>
    <p>
        By default, companies do not require a user name or password to gain access to them.
        You can define users and passwords if you like, by clicking "Setup" on the main menu
        and then "User Logins". The choice to require user names and passwords is per company -
        you can set this up for one company but not another.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be aware that the user name and password mechanism in this software is not
        particularly strong from a security perspective. It will prevent unauthorized people
        from accessing a company through the software, but it does not encrypt your
        data or prevent technically sophisticated people from looking directly at the data
        files to learn what they want. It is intended as a tool to keep curious people
        from seeing things, not as a defense against hackers.
        If you really want to protect your information, use
        the security features of Windows to control access to the folder containing your
        company.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you change your mind about having user names and passwords, or forget your
        password, you can remove all user names and passwords from a company by
        deleting a file named "Security.xml" from the folder containing your
        company files.
