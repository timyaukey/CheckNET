    <h1>Technical Notes</h1>
    <p>
        You don't need to know any of this information for normal use of the software,
        except for making backups.
        But sometimes it helps when strange situations come up or you are trying to
        diagnose problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Company Data Files</h2>
    <p>
        Each company is stored in a separate folder, which can be anywhere on the computer
        or in a shared network folder. Every company folder is entirely self-contained.
        All the data needed to work with a company is in this folder, and there are no data
        files shared between companies stored outside the company folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every company folder has several standard subfolders. The most important is the "Accounts"
        subfolder, which contains two files for each account in your company - "(accountname).act"
        and "(accountname).rep". The ".act" file contains all the account settings, registers,
        and transactions. The ".rep" file contains a small amount of information related to
        generated transactions in that account. If the account has any generated transactions,
        there will be a folder named "(accountname).act.gen" with the definitions for those
        generated transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the data shared between accounts, like your category list, is in files in the
        top level company folder. For example, your category list is in "shared.cat",
        your budget types are in "shared.bud", and your memorized transactions are
        in "PayeeList.xml".
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to move a company to a different place, for example a different
        folder on your hard drive or even a different computer, all you have to do is
        physically move the company folder. When you start the software you always have
        the option to browse and find your company folder, and that's how you'll tell
        the software the new location.
    </p>
    <h2>Backups</h2>
    <p>
        Because each company is entirely self-contained in its own folder, you can make
        a complete backup of any company simply by making a copy of this folder. This
        can be as simple as making a copy with Windows Explorer, or you can use any
        backup utility. To restore a backup, just restore that folder and point the
        software to it when you start the software.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to backups you create outside the software by copying the company
        folder, the software automatically makes a backup copy of the ".act" file of
        any account that's been changed any time that account is saved. These individual
        account backups are all stored in the "Backup" subfolder of the company folder,
        under the original ".act" file name with a date appended to the name.
    </p>
    <p>
        The software automatically deletes some of your older individual account backups
        every time it creates a new one. It keeps the 100(!) most recent backups of each account
        for the current day, the 10 most recent backups of each account for each day for days 2 through 5,
        and the single most recent backup of each account for days 6 through 30. All backups older than
        30 days are deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can restore these individual account backups by copying the backup file for
        that account over the original account ".act" file and restarting the software.
        This requires that the shared definition files contain all definitions used
        in the backup account. For example, don't restore a backup of an account
        if you've deleted a category that the old version of the account uses.
    </p>
    <h2>Event Logs</h2>
    <p>
        The software keeps a log of every transaction you create, edit or delete in every account.
        This log contains ALL operations that affect a transaction, not just manual edits via
        a register. Thus it also includes transactions created by an import, transactions
        updated by marking them as "reconciled" during bank reconciliation, everything.
        This log contains all the important details of these transactions like date, check number,
        payee name, category, and amount. In the case of edited transactions it contains the 
        "before" and "after" versions of the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time an account is saved, the software also writes a new log file for that account with all the
        log entries accumulated since the last time a log file was written for that account. All these
        log files are saved in the "EventLogs" subfolder of your company folder. There is a
        separate subfolder of "EventLogs" for every month and year, and individual log files
        are saved in those subfolders. The individual log files are in XML format, and can
        be easily viewed in any text editor or even many web browsers. Since every account
        gets its own log files, the log files are named the same as the ".act" file plus
        a date and time. Unlike backup files created by the software, old event log files
        are never purged by the software. This should not create a problem, because
        the individual log files are very small. At any time you can manually delete
        individual log files or the year & month folders they are stored in, if you 
        want to get back the disk space.
    </p>
    <h2>Using With File Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        The software is designed to allow a company folder to be shared by file sharing
        utilties such as Dropbox and OneDrive. The file sharing utility simply gives
        every computer its own copy of the company folder, and as soon as any computer
        saves the company the file sharing utility replicates all changes to the
        other computers.
    </p>
    <p>
        This capability does NOT mean multiple computers can have the company open
        at one time. If you do, and multiple computers save the same account,
        only the changes made by the last computer that saves the account will be remembered.
        To avoid accidental overwriting, it is best for all users to agree that one
        specific computer will be used to make all changes, and all the others
        will only use the software to view information. Alternatively, you can
        choose one person as the only one who makes changes, and unless you have
        a way to be multiple places at once you should not have a problem with
        multiple computers overwriting each other's work.
    </p>
    <p>
        One huge advantage to putting your company folder(s) in a shared location
        is this creates immediate backups on the other computers every time you
        save your company. If you need to restore your company to any earlier
        point in time, just use your file sharing utility to undo changes
        to your company folder back to that date and time.
