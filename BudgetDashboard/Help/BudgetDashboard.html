    <h1>Budget Dashboard</h1>
    <p>
        The budget dashboard shows an easy to review summary of how you budgeted and
        have spent money. It shows the totals of your "budgeted" and "unbudgeted"
        income and expenses, for a series of budget periods of uniform size
        (such as a series of two week budget periods).
        "Budgeted" amounts are splits applied to a budget transaction, and unused amounts
        remaining on a budget transaction. "Unbudgeted" amounts are splits with no budget type,
        or no matching budget transaction for that budget type.
        For budgeted figures, it keeps track of the budget limits and the actual amounts used (so far). 
        For cells representing a budget total for one period,
        it can show a list of all the transactions that went into that period total.
        The budgets are displayed in a table, with a different budget
        in each row and a different period in each column.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Included In Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
        The budget dashboard includes data from budget and regular (bank) transactions
        in specific accounts in your company,
        starting on a date you specify and continuing for the number of budget periods you specify.
        Regular (bank) transactions are included regardless of whether their "fake" box is checked.
        Exactly which accounts and which transactions are included depends on the type
        of budget figures you wish to calculate: "cash" and "income and expense".
    </p>
    <h2>Cash Budget Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
        For a cash budget, the software includes all budget and regular (bank) transactions,
        but only from checking and savings accounts in your company. It shows real money
        actually received and spent. This is typically
        the type of budget you'll use for home finances, or if you're a business but
        you do cash basis accounting or don't use separate accounts receivable and account payable accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key distinguishing fact about this kind of budget it that it is "cash basis",
        using accounting terminology. This means that income and expenses are
        allocated to the budget periods (columns) when the income actually arrives
        or the expenses are actually paid, not when they are accrued. For example, when your
        customer pays an invoice you sent them rather than you sent the invoice to them,
        or when you paid a bill rather than when you received the invoice or statement.
    </p>
    <h2>Income and Expense Budget Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
        For an income and expense budget, the software includes all budget and regular (bank)
        transactions in ALL the accounts in your company - including loan accounts,
        credit cards, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and everything else.
        This is typically the type of budget a business will use, particularly if
        they use accounts receivable and accounts payable accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only exclusion from this type of budget is splits that transfer money to
        a different balance sheet account. For example, payments made to reduce your
        accounts receivable account. These are not counted because the expenses
        are represented in the dashboard by the transactions that added the invoice
        to your accounts payable, not by the transaction that paid it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key distinguishing fact about this kind of budget is that it is "accrual basis",
        using accounting terminology. This means that income is allocated to the period when
        it became owed to you, and expenses are allocated to the period when they became
        owed by you.
    </p>
    <p>
        A business that uses accrual basis accounting may choose to use both a cash basis
        budget and an income and expense budget. The cash basis budget would be used to
        track and forecast cashflow, and the income and expense budget would be used to
        track how much of each income and expense budget has actually been accrued regardless
        of whether the money has arrived or been paid yet. Using dual budgets like this
        doesn't make any more work, because both types are computed from the same data.
    </p>
    <h2>Budgets and Categories Are Rows</h2>
    <p>
        As mentioned in the introduction, the dashboard includes both budgeted and unbudgeted
        amounts. All splits that are not applied to a budget are totalled up under the
        category of the split, and there will be a row in the dashboard for that category.
        Essentially, categories are treated like budgets for splits that are not applied
        to a budget.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each budget will have its own row in the dashboard as well, totalling up
        splits applied to that budget and unused amounts from budget transactions
        for that budget type. There may actually be more than one row for a budget
        type, depending on how the budget transaction was created: There is one row
        for each sequence of generated budget transactions for each budget type,
        and one row for uses of each
        budget type outside any generated transaction sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a generated
        sequence of weekly budget transactions of budget type "entertainment" for
        ordinary weekly entertainment gets its
        own row because it's a generated sequence, and a separate one time
        budget transaction for your 50th wedding anniversary
        for the same "entertainment" budget type will get its own row.
        Each generated sequence of budget transactions is treated
        as a separate budget in this dashboard. And budget transactions not
        belonging to a generated sequence are lumped together with all other
        budget transactions of the same type.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason each generated transaction sequence gets its own dashboard
        row is that each generated sequence usually represents a distinct
        use of a budget, and having a separate row for each one lets you
        track that purpose separately. We could do the same thing for
        category usage of splits not applied to budgets, but we've found
        in practical terms that there tend to be many more generated
        transaction sequences for regular (bank) transactions than
        for budget transactions, and having a separate row for each one
        makes the dashboard so long that it's cumbersome to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        After everything is totalled up for each dashboard row, each row
        is assigned to the credits section of the dashboard (the top part)
        if the total amount is a positive number, or assigned to debits
        section (the bottom part) if the total is a negative number.
        There is an additional subtotal row at the bottom of each section,
        adding up all credit and all debits.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that using the row total to determine if a row belongs in
        the credit or debit section means that it is possible a category
        row for an income category ("I:" prefix) will end up in the debit
        section, and a row for an expense category ("E:" prefix) will end
        up in the credit section. This is not necessarily an error, but
        it probably merits a closer look at the transactions to see
        if they are all entered correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>Budget Periods Are Columns</h2>
    <p>
        When you open the dashboard it asks the number of days in each budget period,
        the starting date of the first budget period, and how many budget periods
        to display. There will be one column in the dashboard display for
        each budget period, labelled with the starting date of the period
        at the top of each column.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is one more column before the first budget period with the net sum of
        all transactions across all columns in each row.
    </p>
    <h2>Which Budget Period Each Transaction Is Allocated To</h2>
    <p>
        Every dollar amount that is added to the dashboard is associated with a
        date, and that date determines which budget period the amount is added
        to. The rule for determining that date is simple, but not necessarily
        obvious: Every split uses the date of the regular (bank) transaction
        it belongs to, and the unused amount of each budget transaction uses
        the budget transaction date.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reasoning behind this is to allocate dollars received or spent
        to the date that actually happened, rather than acting like everything
        happened on the date of the budget it was applied to. Applying it to
        the actual event date is more accurate, particularly if you happen
        to use budget transactions whose length spans multiple budget
        periods as specified to the dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it may be more accurate, using dates this way can lead to confusing results
        if you don't understand how the dates work. The problem is that
        a split may be applied to a different dashboard column than the
        budget it is applied to, because the split date (the regular transaction date)
        is different than the budget date. This is most likely to happen
        if the periods you display on the dashboard to not match the
        periods used on your budget transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this reason, if it is at all possible we recommend using uniform
        budget period lengths everywhere so the dashboard periods match up
        to the budget transaction periods.
    </p>
    <h2>Budget Percent Used</h2>
    <p>
        For budget type rows, the dashboard uses a color coded bar of varying length
        at the bottom of each cell to show how much of the budgeted amount has been used.
        The length of the bar indicates how much
        has been used. A green bar means there is money left in the budget,
        and the length of the bar in relation to the width of the cell is the
        percentage of the budget amount used. For example, a green bar 75%
        of the width of the cell means 75% of the budget has been spent.
        A yellow bar means you are over budget, but less than double the
        amount. So a yellow bar 25% of the cell width means you've used
        125% of the budget. A red bar means you've used more than double
        the budget amount, up to three times. For example, a red bar 50%
        of the width of the cell means you've used 250% of the budget amount.
        Above 300% you just get a 300% bar. No bar at all means you haven't
        used any of that budget.
    </p>
    <p>
        The budget amount used is the amount of splits assigned to the budget
        transaction, regardless of the date of the regular transaction those
        splits belong to. So a split might be assigned to one column of the
        dashboard, but affect the color bar of a different column. This is
        another example of how the rules for determining budget period
        can produce unexpected results, and another reason why the budget
        dashboard will produce results that are more useful and easier to
        understand if your budget transactions use budget periods that
        match the dashboard periods.
    </p>
    <h2>Showing Budget Details</h2>
    <p>
        You can see all the details that went into any row for any budget
        period by clicking the mouse on that cell. When you click that
        cell it will display a list of all the related transactions on
        the panel at the righthand side of the dashboard window. This list
        will include all the splits whose transaction dates are in that
        period, and all the budget transactions whose end dates are in
        that period. For budget transactions, the amount will be the same
        amount that shows in the transaction register - the amount remaining
        for that budget.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will also show some summary figures for that
        budget period and budget type / category at the bottom of the panel.
        These summary figures can be confusing if you have splits applied
        to different columns than the budgets, as described above.
        The first summary figure, "Total of Above Detail", is always the number
        shown in the table cell. The other summary figures are different
        depending on whether the row is for a category or a budget type.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a category row the summary just shows the sum of all original amounts for
        splits on transactions that are part of a generated transaction
        sequence. This "generated total" is what you originally expected
        the transaction amounts to be, so it's like a budget you set for
        that category and it's helpful to compare it to the actual total
        of real transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        For budget type rows the summary shows totals of the original (from generated transactions)
        budget limits, and the current budget limits. As will be explained below,
        it is easy to change budget limits from inside this dashboard, and
        such changes will cause the current budget limit total to change
        but not the original budget limit.
    </p>
    <h2>Totals and Running Balance</h2>
    <p>
        The dashboard has a column with the sums of all the row totals,
        and several rows showing subtotals for credit rows, debit rows, and
        grand totals for each column. The final row in the dashboard shows
        a running end of period balance, which lets you see if you are
        running cummulatively under or over budget as of the end of
        each budget period. The beginning balance will be the sum of the balances
        of all accounts included in the dashboard, as of the end of the
        day before the dashboard starting date. The running balance
        at the end of each period should be the sum of the balances
        of all accounts included in the dashboard as of the end date
        of that period.
    </p>
    <h2>Moving Money Between Budgets</h2>
    <p>
        The dashboard is not just for looking at your budgets - you can
        change them here as well! After you click on any period cell
        for a budget type row (not a category row), at the bottom of
        the righthand panel you will see several controls for changing
        the budget limit. You can set the amount of any budget in that
        cell, but more useful is to subtract an amount. This places
        the amount on a clipboard, so you can click in a different
        cell and then add the same amount to a different budget.
        In essence, when you subtract and add like this you are
        moving that amount from one budget to another.
